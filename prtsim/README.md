| element | character | interaction |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| air | `.` | inert |
| building block | `#` | inert, not affected by gravity |
| sand | `$` | solid dynamics |
| water block | `~` | fluid dynamics |

> **Main takeaway**: simulate movement of any mutable particles *(sand, water)* around the static particles
