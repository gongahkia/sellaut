| element | character | interaction |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| air | `.` | inert, denser than effervesence |
| flammable block | `$` | set on fire by fire block, upon combustion creates soot and effervesence block, affected by solid dynamics and gravity |
| oil block | `*` | set on fire by fire block, upon combustion creates effervesence block, affected by fluid dynamics |
| fire block | `^` | sets oil and flammable blocks on fire, fire doused by water |
| water block | `~` | denser than oil, affected by general fluid dynamics, displaced by other solid blocks, water douses fire |
| non-flammable block | `#` | inert, not affected by gravity |
| soot block | `_` | produced upon combustion of flammable block, affected by gravity, replaced by flammable blocks |
| effervesence block | `%` | produced upon combustion of oil and flammable block, less dense than effervesence and rises above, will rise above water and oil also |
