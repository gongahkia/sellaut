| element | character | interaction |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| air | `.` | inert, denser than effervesence |
| sand | `$` | affected by solid dynamics and gravity |
| oil block | `*` | less dense than water, affected by fluid dynamics |
| water block | `~` | denser than oil, affected by general fluid dynamics, displaced by other solid blocks, water douses fire |
| building block | `#` | not affected by gravity |
| effervesence block | `%` |  less dense than air and rises above, will rise above water and oil also |
